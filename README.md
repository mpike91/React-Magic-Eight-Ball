# React - Magic Eight Ball
Simple app emulating the classic Magic Eight Ball. "Ask" a question, click on the Eight Ball, and then it will auto-generate one of the classic Eight Ball responses. The color will correspond to the favorability of the response. This app was a practice with state control and component rendering. It tracks the number of times each response "color" populates. I also practiced event handling in React with this app.
